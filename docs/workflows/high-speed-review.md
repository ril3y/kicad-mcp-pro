# High-Speed Review Workflow

This workflow uses only MCP tools and headless-safe checks where possible. It is
intended as a preflight before a human layout review, not as a replacement for
field solving or lab validation.

## 1. Set the Project and Intent

Start by setting the active KiCad project, then record the nets and frequencies
that deserve stricter routing and EMC checks:

```text
kicad_set_project(project_dir="/path/to/project")
project_set_design_intent(
  critical_nets=["USB_DP", "USB_DN", "PCIE_TX_P", "PCIE_TX_N"],
  critical_frequencies_mhz=[5000.0, 8000.0],
  thermal_hotspots=["U1", "U7"]
)
```

The `critical_nets` list is reused by placement scoring, EMC return-path checks,
and the high-speed review loop.

## 2. Check Stackup and Time-Domain Routing

Use `pcb_get_stackup` to confirm dielectric and copper data, then run
`route_tune_time_domain` for timing-critical nets. On KiCad 10 projects the tool
derives required length from per-layer dielectric data; KiCad 9 keeps the legacy
length-based fallback.

```text
route_tune_time_domain(
  net_name="USB_DP",
  target_delay_ps=250.0,
  layer="F_Cu",
  tolerance_pct=5.0
)
```

## 3. Review Via Stubs

`si_check_via_stub` now reports the quarter-wave resonant frequency for each
stub and flags any stub within 10 percent of a frequency listed in
`critical_frequencies_mhz`.

```text
si_check_via_stub(net_name="PCIE_TX_P", max_stub_mm=0.8, dielectric_constant=4.0)
```

Treat a `CRITICAL resonance near ... MHz` line as a routing-review escalation:
backdrill, use blind/buried vias, shorten the stub, or move the layer transition.

## 4. Score Placement Before Routing

Run `pcb_score_placement` after coarse placement. The score includes a
critical-net Manhattan length proxy and thermal-hotspot proximity signal, so it
can catch long high-speed detours and clustered hot parts before routing starts.

## 5. Route and Inspect FreeRouting Telemetry

When a DSN is available, `route_autoroute_freerouting` prefers Docker with the
pinned `ghcr.io/freerouting/freerouting:1.9.0` image (v1 CLI runner — v2.x
ships an HTTP server entrypoint the integration does not yet drive) and falls
back to the JAR runner. The result includes routed percentage, total nets, unrouted nets, pass
count, wall time, SES path, and the last 4 KB of router output.

```text
route_autoroute_freerouting(
  dsn_path="output/routing/board.dsn",
  max_passes=100,
  threads=8,
  exclude_nets=["GND", "SHIELD"],
  drc_report_path="output/routing/freerouting.drc.json"
)
```

## 6. Run PI and EMC Preflight

For power and thermal risk, use `pdn_calculate_voltage_drop`,
`pdn_check_copper_weight`, and `thermal_calculate_via_count`. The thermal via
tool accepts both the legacy `power_w` mode and the package-envelope mode:

```text
thermal_calculate_via_count(
  package_power_w=2.0,
  ambient_c=35.0,
  max_junction_c=95.0,
  theta_ja_deg_c_w=60.0,
  via_diameter_mm=0.3
)
```

For EMC, call `emc_check_return_path_continuity` without a signal name to sweep
the design-intent critical nets automatically:

```text
emc_check_return_path_continuity(reference_plane_layer="auto", search_radius_mm=2.0)
```

Any reported violation includes a simple geometry hint (`net=..., radius=...mm`)
so an agent can propose stitching vias or plane-continuity edits.

## 7. Commit a Checkpoint

If the board is improving, create a reversible checkpoint before the next
iteration:

```text
vcs_commit_checkpoint(message="High-speed preflight pass")
```

Keep manual SI/PI simulation and lab validation in the loop for final release.
